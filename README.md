## Description:

* Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

* Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

## Installation Process:
npm init to initialize package.json
npm install to install dependencies
npm i mysql
npm i express
npm i express-handlebars
npm i method-override: allows use of verbs such as PUT and DELETE
npm i body-parser: parse information under the req.body property where client does not allow

## Usage:
  User's will utilize the MVC model to create, update, and delete burgers. A user is allowed to add a new burger of their choosing. Once a burger is created they will the have the ability to DEVOUR the burger. After the burger is devoured it will then be placed under a devoured section which can then be deleted by the user.
